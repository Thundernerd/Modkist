# dotnetzip-for-unity #
This is a stripped-down version of DotNetZip (no BZip2/GZip support for now) with some fixes so it can be used on Unity projects, including those that target Android and iOS.

This project is licensed under the Ms-PL, packaged within this project as
"License.txt".

Thanks to Ed Ropple <ed+dotnetzip@edropple.com> for the original GitHub mirror of DotNetZip.

## How to use ##
Clone the repository and compile the project, or download the already compiled libraries from the __Binaries__ folder. Drop them in your Unity project's __Assets/Plugins__ folder and you are good to go.

The library has been extensively tested in Android devices, however, some issues can arise when targetting iOS devices. Feel free to report any bugs you find.
